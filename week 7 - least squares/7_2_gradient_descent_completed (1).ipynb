    "## Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the basic principles of gradient descent. Let us recall that gradient descent is an gradient-based iterative optimization method. The optimization starts from a certain initial point $\\mathbf{x}_0$, which is at each step being shifted a little against the direction of the gradient. Since gradient represents the direction of the steepest ascent of a function at the specified point, by going against the direction of the gradient the function will be minimized.\n",

    "The update rule which is applied at every step to compute the next point $\\mathbf{x}_{i+1}$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{x}_{i+1} = \\mathbf{x}_i - \\gamma \\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_i)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ is the gradient of the minimized function and $\\gamma$, usually a small number from interval $( 0, 1 \\rangle$, is the learning rate.\n",
